No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

              MIT URTC is an internationally-renowned research conference, for undergraduates and by undergraduates.

              Our annual conferences are themed around incredible breakthroughs in engineering and technological research made by student researchers at the undergraduate level all over the country. With our yearly events, participants are given the exciting opportunity to present, discuss, and develop solutions for advancing technology for humanity.

              Staffed by a group of students from MIT working in collaboration with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics and Engineers (IEEE), we boast a wide variety of programming at each conference such as paper/poster presentations by our student presenters, talks and panels by industry leaders, and networking and social events.

              This year, URTC will be held under a hybrid modelâ€”we will combine virtual elements from our 2020 and 2021 conferences and in-person elements from all the years that came before that! This change aims to allow participants an authentic conference experience with like-minded peers in the same physical environment while also providing those who are unable to travel to MIT to experience the conference virtually. Both student presenters and general attendees are eligible to participate in either method.

              Note: we are not hosting two separate in-person and virtual conferences! Instead, we are providing a means for URTC participants to attend and present virtually through live streaming. To accommodate this combined method, many of our events will be run in a modified format.

              When registering for the conference, attendees can choose to attend either in-person or virtually.
