//     bio: 'Harold (Hal) Abelson is Class of 1922 Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a Fellow of the IEEE. He holds an A.B. degree from Princeton University and a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from MIT. In 1992, Abelson was designated as one of MIT\'s six inaugural MacVicar Faculty Fellows, in recognition of his significant and sustained contributions to teaching and undergraduate education. Abelson was recipient in 1992 of the Bose Award (MIT\'s School of Engineering teaching award), winner of the 1995 Taylor L. Booth Education Award given by IEEE Computer Society, cited for his continued contributions to the pedagogy and teaching of introductory computer science, and of the 2012 ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education, and winner of the 2011 ACM Karl Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. Abelson has played key roles in fostering MIT institutional educational technology initiatives including MIT OpenCourseWare and DSpace, and he has served as co-chair of the MIT Council on Educational Technology, which oversees MIT\'s strategic educational technology activities and investments. He is a leader in the worldwide movement towards openness and democratization of culture and intellectual resources. He was a founding director of Creative Commons, Public Knowledge, and the Free Software Foundation, and a director of the Center for Democracy and Technology — organizations that are devoted to strengthening the global intellectual commons. Abelson been active since the 1970\'s in using computation as a conceptual framework in teaching. He directed the first implementation of children\'s computer language Logo for the Apple Computer, which made the language widely available on personal computers beginning in 1981; and he published a widely selling book on Logo in 1982. His book Turtle Geometry, written with Andy diSessa in 1981, presented a computational approach to geometry was cited as \'the first step in a revolutionary change in the entire teaching/learning process.\' Abelson leads the development of MIT App Inventor. App Inventor, started by Abelson when he was a visiting faculty member at Google Research, is a Web-based development system aimed at making it easy for young students -- or anyone -- to create original mobile applications. Abelson is codirector of the MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative, which collaborates with policymakers and technologists to improve the trustworthiness and effectiveness of interconnected digital systems like the Internet. More generally, Abelson has a broad interest in information technology and policy, and he developed and teaches The MIT course Foundations of Information Policy. He co-authored the 2008 book Blown to Bits, which describes, in non-technical terms, the cultural and political disruptions caused by the information explosion. Together with MIT colleague Gerald Sussman, Abelson developed the computer science subject, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is organized around the notion that a computer language is primarily a formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology, rather than just a way to get a computer to perform operations. This work, through a popular computer science textbook by Abelson and Gerald and Julie Sussman, videos of their lectures, and the availability on personal computers of the Scheme dialect of Lisp (used in teaching the course), has had a world-wide impact on university computer-science education. This work served as MIT\'s own introductory computer science subject from 1980 until 2007.',
//     title: 'MIT App Inventor, From Computational Thinking to Computational Action',
//     abstact: 'Starting from its roots in the late 1960s, exposing young people to the ideas of computational thinking has emerged as an important theme in preparing them for effective citizenship in the information society. Beyond just exposure to ideas, we’re now seeing how students as young as primary school can use those ideas to improve life at the personal level, the community level, even the national level. This empowerment through computational action results from the past decade’s developments in mobile computing, cloud services, Internet of things, and machine learning, bringing the world’s most powerful computing tools within the grasp of even beginning learners. In this talk I\'ll survey the work of the MIT App Inventor CSAIL research project.  Our work empowers anyone to create original mobile apps, with a platform that hosts a million people a month.',

//     abstact: 'Forest ecosystem plays a major role in determining the future climate. We need to monitor the forest environment to learn how stressors affect the changes over time. The concept of digital twins and parallel intelligence can be a powerful tool to create a digital replica of a forested land in the cloud with real time connections to the physical forest using radio frequency identification tags and sensors. This is an ambitious goal which requires a significant number of sensors which are low cost, reliable and power efficient. We also require extremely efficient spectrum sharing strategies to make this network economical, while not interfering with other existing networks. In this talk, we will take a deeper look at deep learning and artificial intelligence to learn how a digital forest twin can operate using a radio intelligent system. If you are interested to learn about wireless sensing, networking, and AI you will find this talk interesting. The main goal of this research is to predict abrupt or extreme events as well as slow changes in the climate and help develop data driven forest management plans and policies.',

    abstact: 'Analogies are powerful tools. some Nobel-prizes have been won by scientists who started with Analogies. Maxwell developed his equations in electromagnetics by using analogs  to fluid flow. In this talk, as an example, I will illustrate the power of analogies between millions of people running, back and forth in circles and the development of MR imaging. Various aspects of MRI will be related to this simple analogy. The genesis of this analogy came from Sir Peter Mansfield, who later won the Nobel, for the creation of the first live image of a human body part using MRI. The key to using analogies is by strating with a simple model and thenexpanding it as necessary.',

//     abstact: 'Machines are beginning to catch up with humans in many ways, for example in vision, speech, autonomous driving, and robot locomotion. But humans still put robots to shame when using their hands for everyday tasks. Why are robots so bad at manipulation? After all, robot hands are built with precision parts, while human hands are built from squishy flesh. The trick is that human hands are covered with tactile sensors and filled with proprioceptive sensors, and sensory data is needed for controlling interactions with the world. My lab builds robot fingers that are soft like human fingers and which have higher resolution touch sensing than human fingers. Our goal is to give robots a sense of touch, and to use tactile information to guide skillful manipulation. A robot equipped with our fingers can fold a towel or tell if an avocado is ripe.',
