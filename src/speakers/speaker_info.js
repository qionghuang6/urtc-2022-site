    title: 'Digital Radio Intelligent Forest Twin (DRIFT)',
    abstact: 'Forest ecosystem plays a major role in determining the future climate. We need to monitor the forest environment to learn how stressors affect the changes over time. The concept of digital twins and parallel intelligence can be a powerful tool to create a digital replica of a forested land in the cloud with real time connections to the physical forest using radio frequency identification tags and sensors. This is an ambitious goal which requires a significant number of sensors which are low cost, reliable and power efficient. We also require extremely efficient spectrum sharing strategies to make this network economical, while not interfering with other existing networks. In this talk, we will take a deeper look at deep learning and artificial intelligence to learn how a digital forest twin can operate using a radio intelligent system. If you are interested to learn about wireless sensing, networking, and AI you will find this talk interesting. The main goal of this research is to predict abrupt or extreme events as well as slow changes in the climate and help develop data driven forest management plans and policies.',
